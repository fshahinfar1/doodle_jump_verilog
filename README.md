# Doodle Jump (Implemented in Verilog)
I have developed a game having simple mechanics of doodle jump written in verilog HDL for
Computer Aided Design course of Iran University of Science and Technology (Fall 2019).

## Display
The dump file generated when running test bench can be passed to the module in display directory.
This module displayes the game in graphical interface using pygame for this purpose.
(A simple incomplete module has been writen for reading .vcd files)
